Eris is a porting of [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) and property-based testing tools to the PHP and PHPUnit ecosystem.

In property-based testing, several properties that the System Under Test must respect are defined, and a large sample of generated inputs is sent to it in an attempt to break the properties.

## Compatibility

- PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
- PHPUnit 10.x, 11.x

## Installation

You can install Eris through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) by running the following command in your terminal:

```
composer require --dev giorgiosironi/eris
```

You can run some of Eris example tests with `vendor/bin/phpunit vendor/giorgiosironi/eris/examples`.

Here is an [empty sample project](https://github.com/giorgiosironi/eris-example) installing Eris.

Please note the project is in alpha stage and the API may change at any time.

## Example usage within PHPUnit

This test tries to verify that natural numbers from 0 to 1000 are all smaller than 42. It's a failing test designed to show you an example of error message.

```php
<?php
use Eris\Generators;

class ReadmeTest extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    use \Eris\TestTrait;

    public function testNaturalNumbersMagnitude()
    {
        $this->forAll(
            Generators::choose(0, 1000)
        )
            ->then(function($number) {
                $this->assertTrue(
                    $number < 42,
                    "$number is not less than 42 apparently"
                );
            });
    }
}
```

Eris generates a sample of elements from the required domain (here the integers from 0 to 1000) and verifies a property on each of them, stopping at the first failure.

```bash

FAILURES!

```

Eris also tries to shrink the input after a failure, giving you the simplest input that still fails the test. In this example, the original input was probably something like `562`, but Eris tries to make it smaller until the test became green again. The smallest value that still fails the test is the one presented to you.

## Support and contributing

Feel free to open issues on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/giorgiosironi/eris/issues) for support and feature requests.

Pull requests are welcome. For anything longer than a few lines it's worth to open an issue first to get feedback on the intended solution and whether it will integrate well with the rest of the codebase.
